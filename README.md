# soothing-sudoku

A Sudoku app that allows users to play Sudoku. The app will have a clean and simple interface with a grid layout for the Sudoku puzzle. It should be interactive, allowing users to input numbers into the grid, with features to check their progress and get hints if needed. The color scheme should be soothing and not too vibrant, with a focus on readability and user experience. The app should also have a feature to generate new puzzles of varying difficulties, ensuring a fresh challenge for the user each time they play.
